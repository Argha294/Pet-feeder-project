Check to see if it's feeding time.  

If so, make sure there is food in the food storage. 

Mount a servo motor that can discharge food if there is any. 

Measure the bowl for 10 minutes. 

The "Pet did not eat" message is sent if the weight remains unchanged. 

Notify the user when the food storage is empty with the text "Food bin empty."
